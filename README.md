## Debt Portfolio Analysis – Case Study

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of two debt portfolios, focusing on performance evaluation and comparative decision-making.
The analysis defines and computes key KPIs including recovery rate, collections efficiency, portfolio volatility, and cohort-based performance.
Exploratory analysis and visualizations are used to assess trends, seasonality, and risk–return trade-offs.
Based on the evaluated metrics, the portfolios are compared under consistent assumptions to identify relative strengths and weaknesses.
The project emphasizes analytical reasoning, metric design, and clear communication of insights.
The dataset and scenario are constructed for demonstration purposes.
